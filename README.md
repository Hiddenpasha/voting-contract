# Voting Contract

This is my first Solidity project!

## Description

A simple smart contract for voting on proposals.  
Members can create proposals and cast votes. When a proposal gets enough "Yes" votes (10), it is executed.

## How to use

- Deploy the contract with the addresses of members.
- Members can create proposals and vote.
- When a proposal receives 10 "Yes" votes, it triggers the execution.
